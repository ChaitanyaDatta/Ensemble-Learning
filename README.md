# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction 
This a project where Cardiovascular disease is predicted using an ensemble approach, the base classifiers used in the model are Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Xtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). I have published research articles on this topic and I made it public to help others in creating new machine learning frameworks.
