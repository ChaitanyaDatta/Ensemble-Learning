# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction 
This a project where Cardiovascular disease is predicted using an ensemble approach, the base classifiers used in the model are Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Xtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). I have published research articles on this topic and I made it public to help others in creating new machine learning frameworks. To know more about this project, visit the article links provided below.

# Multi-Disease-Prediction
This a project where Chronic Kidney Disease and Diabetes is predicted using an ensemble approach, the base classifiers used in the model are Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR) and Neural Networks (NN). I have published research articles on this topic and I made it public to help others in creating new machine learning frameworks.
